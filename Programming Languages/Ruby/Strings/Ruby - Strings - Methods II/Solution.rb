# In this tutorial, we'll learn about the methods in String class that help us
# to search and replace portions of the string based on a text or pattern.
#
# * 'String.include?(str)': Returns 'true' if the string contains the given
#   string 'str' or character. Very simple!
#
#     >> "hello".include? "lo"
#     => true
#     >> "hello".include? "ol"
#     => false
#
# * 'String.gsub(pattern, <hash|replacement>)': Returns a new string with all
#   the occurrences of the pattern substituted for the second argument: The
#   pattern is typically a Regexp, but a string can also be used.
#
#     >> "hello".gsub(/[aeiou]/, '*')
#     => "h*ll*"
#     >> "hello".gsub(/([aeiou])/, '')
#     => "hll"
#
# Either method will depend upon the problem you are trying to solve, and the
# nature of input-output behavior you desire.
#
# In this challenge, your task is to write the following methods:
#
#   * 'mask_article': which appends strike tags around certain words in a text.
#     The method takes 2 arguments: A 'string' and an array of 'words'. It then
#     replaces all the instances of 'words' in the 'string' with the modified
#     version.
#
#   * A helper method 'strike', which given one 'string', appends strike off
#     HTML tags around it. The strike off HTML tag is '<strike></strike>'.
#
#   For example:
#
#     >> strike("Meow!")
#     => "<strike>Meow!</strike>"
#     >> strike("Foolan Barik")
#     => "<strike>Foolan Barik</strike>"
#     >> mask_article("Hello World! This is trash!", ["trash"])
#     => "Hello World! This is <strike>trash</strike>!"
#
#   Apply the helper method in completing your main method.

def strike(str)
  return "<strike>#{str}</strike>"
end

def mask_article(str, arr)
  arr.each do |word|
    str = str.gsub(word, strike(word))
  end
  return str
