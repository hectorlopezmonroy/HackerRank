/*
 * In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using if-else conditional
 * statements to automate decision-making processes. An if-else statement has
 * the following logical flow:
 *
 *          IF (A = TRUE)         *
 *          THEN B               \|/
 *          ELSE C     ___TRUE___/A\___FALSE___
 *          END IF    |          \ /           |
 *                    B________________________C
 *                               \|/
 *                                *
 *
 * Task
 * Given an integer, 'n', perform the following conditional actions:
 *   * If 'n' is odd, print "Weird".
 *   * If 'n' is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print "Not Weird".
 *   * If 'n' is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print "Weird".
 *   * If 'n' is even and greater than 20, print "Not Weird".
 *
 * Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not 'n' is
 * weird.
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * A single line containing a positive integer, 'n'.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 *
 * Output Format
 *
 * Print "Weird" if the number is weird; otherwise, print "Not Weird".
 *
 * Sample Input 0
 *
 * 3
 *
 * Sample Output 0
 *
 * Weird
 *
 * Sample Input 1
 *
 * 24
 *
 * Sample Output
 *
 * Not Weird
 *
 * Explanation
 *
 * Sample Case 0: n = 3
 * 'n' is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print "Weird".
 *
 * Sample Case 1: n = 24
 * n > 20 and 'n' is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print "Not Weird".
